        <h2>Tesla Reports Strong Q4 Earnings, Stock Jumps 12%</h2>
        <p><strong>Published:</strong> January 25, 2024</p>
        
        <p>Tesla Inc. (TSLA) reported better-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings yesterday, sending shares soaring 12% in after-hours trading. The electric vehicle giant posted earnings per share of $0.71, beating analyst estimates of $0.64.</p>
        
        <p>The company delivered 484,507 vehicles in Q4, a 20% increase from the previous quarter. CEO Elon Musk highlighted the success of the Model Y and announced plans for expanded production at the Austin Gigafactory.</p>
        
        <p>"We're seeing unprecedented demand for electric vehicles globally," Musk said during the earnings call. "Our investment in battery technology and autonomous driving capabilities positions us well for 2024."</p>
        
        <p>The strong performance also benefited other EV stocks, with Rivian (RIVN) and Lucid Motors (LCID) rising 5% and 7% respectively in extended trading. Traditional automakers like Ford (F) and General Motors (GM) also saw modest gains as investors remain optimistic about the EV sector.</p>
        
        <p>Tesla's energy storage division reported record installations, generating $1.4 billion in revenue. The company's solar panel business also showed improvement with 35% growth year-over-year.</p>
        
        <p>Looking ahead, Tesla plans to begin production of the Cybertruck at scale and expects to maintain vehicle delivery growth of at least 20% annually. The company also announced a $25 billion investment in charging infrastructure across North America.</p>
